# PrimeSum
Read in a sequence of 32-bit signed integers (one per line) until zero. Add up the prime integers. Then
output on a line the statement “The sum of the primes is x.” where x is the sum (also representable
as a 32-bit integer).
The input should be taken from keyboard/stdin/System.in.

Sample Input:

1

-2

6

13

0

The output should be sent to console/stdout/System.out.

Sample Output:

The sum of the primes is 13.



A test file is provided with sample inputs. To run the program, in the terminal input the following command:

python3 primesum.py < A1_primesum.in
